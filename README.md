 # SmartBucks App
 
 ## General Info
 
This project was created on behalf of the ISEE lecture of the Summer Semester 2019 that took place at the Faculty of Informatics, Otto-Von-Guericke Universität Magdeburg. This is an Android App programmed with Java (Gradle) through Android Studio and made use of a local SQLlite Database Structure. The core of the backend and the database design were implemented from me, along with some additions to the Frontend design and implementation. Additional functions and features were implemented from my co-project members, Pawan Kumar (pawan.kumar@st.ovgu.de, Github- pawankumar94) , Raj Rajeshwari Prasad (raj.prasad@st.ovgu.de, Github- rajprasad001) and Venkatesh Murugadas - (venkatesh.murugadas@st.ovgu.de, Github - VenkateshDas), students of the Faculty of Informatics, Otto-Von-Guericke Universität Magdeburg.

## App Description

This App will eventually be able to help its user spend their resources in a wise and efficient way and allow them to take control of their spending habits. The following functions are going to be supported:
* Allowing the user to define the category/item names/services that he spend a specific amount of money to
* Given the user's income that has been specified, there will be a real-time update of the money balance
* Observing money-spending history and review statistics about their personal consumer behaviour
