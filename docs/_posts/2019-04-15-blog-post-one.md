Welcome to the First Blog Post of our Team called *SmartBucks*. 
Our team has the name of the App we have envisioned of creating, since we chose the Money Control Project Theme.
We created the logo above because we think that it represents the App's name, as we believe that the app is going to "Enlighten the Pocket"
of the user!

We are going to share below more with you about the theme selection, personal details and motivation of the team's members, and discuss
about factors and decisions we took for our project's organisation (communication, roles etc).

## Reason for choosing 'Money Control' Theme Project ##

![Money Icon](http://icons.iconarchive.com/icons/paomedia/small-n-flat/1024/money-icon.png)
With the help of this app , we can help an individual to plan his/her expenditure according to a fixed budget(as per the future aspects of this project) , 
The main reason behind the selection of this topic is that this project seems to be more realistic and  can reach out to maximum audience irrespective of the 
age of the person as savings and money control are the aspect that every individual is obliged of. 

Apart from this it will also enable a sense of awareness and responsibility amongst users so that they could never fall out of resources in adverse timings .

### Division of responsibility ###

On the basis of tasks to be performed for the successful completion of the project we have distinguished the responsibilities into following categories:-

* Front End (UI/UX)        : Raj , Murugadas
* Back End (Programming)     : Pawan, Theodora
* Documentation  & Testing/Debugging    : All (in equal parts)


### Means of Communication ###

For our team cooperation to be succesful both in a remote and physical way, we have decided to:

* Use Google Drive and Google Docs tools to be able to share and edit common files and content regarding the lecture
* Set up a WhatsApp common group chat about the 
* Dedicate two hours every Friday evening about discussing next weekly plans and laying responsibilities of each member's remote work

### Handling Unexpected Circumstanses ###

Since the project is of our interest we have taken in considerations most of the worst case factors that might show up . Since we all are regular students the only constraint that might show up is allocation of time but as we have fixed regular meetings that issue would not be problematic and regarding the changes in environment particular roles and responsibilities has been assigned to each individual who will be solely responsible for the task .
In the end, *“Team work always accomplishes the dream work”*!

**Thanks for Reading!**
