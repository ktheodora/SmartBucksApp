# Basic Prototype

## Development Strategy
 
 It was a difficult task to keep every team member on the same page as we all had different schedules and was not able to meet often. But this was easily tackled using the communication tool Slack.
 The development of the android application requires the team members to take up on different roles such as Front end development, back end development and documentation.
 We all have to work on the same project file and need to be aware of the updates and addition the team members are contributing to the project files. This was easily done using the GitHub repo that was already provided.We created a new branch named “develop” for the purpose of easy sync and update of the project which was useful as we need not always push to the master branch.
So, GitHub and Slack provided to be very useful tools which helped us to be on the same page throughout the development phase.

## Basic Prototype of SmartBucks

The first phase of building an application is creating a basic prototype which gives us the hope that the concept that was given as a requirement by the customer can be designed and created into a functional application.This part of the developmental phase is crucial to the application as it provides us with insights which cannot be achieved conceptually.

  The workflow for the basic prototype is given below.
