### Section 2.3 Problem Faced :

- Communication and Software
    - Unfortunately the team faced difficulty in the completion of the ***Basic Prototype*** due to lack of communication.
    - Issues were also faced on the Git and Android Studio part due to which it became difficult to synchronise the workflow.
- Frontend
    - It is very important for an Application to look intuitive and ergonomic. Due to lack of knowledge about the general perception of the user, designing the layout of the Activities is a cumbersome task.
- Backend
    - Coding can be fun but finding a bug definitely is not fun. Due to multiple activities and their options, coding becomes difficult. The ids given in the frontend part is not generalised due to which using it in a code becomes tiresome.


## Section 3: Plans and Goals

1. Frontend:-
    - Go through papers and take reference from various applications to gain idea to make frontend more attractive.
    - Sketch all the Activities by 24/05/2019.
    - Get suggestions for the improvement in the design layout
    - Complete the layouts by 27/05/2019 so as to discuss it with TA and get fine suggestions.
    - Generalise the naming convention for ids, so that it is easy for coders to program the backend.

2. Backend:-
    - Look for options to do clean coding and remove glitches from the application.
    - Look for ways to add the database in the application.
    - Learn how to generate statistical data from the entered and calculated date.
    - Learn the ways to send the generated data to the user as a notification.

3. Organisational
    - Communicate more often so as to make our work more efficient and effective.

## Section 4 : Agenda for the Meeting
- Show the ***Basic Prototype*** to the TA and discuss the issues if any.
- Discuss the new Activities and get suggestions for modifications required if any.
- Discuss the requirements and expectations of the TA for the ***Advanced Prototype***.
